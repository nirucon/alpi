# OLD OLD OLD - NOT UPDATED!

My new version: https://github.com/nirucon/alpi-suckless

# alpi

Post-install scripts for **vanilla Arch Linux** that set up my suckless-based desktop (dwm, st, dmenu, slock, slstatus or custom status bar), look & feel, apps, and a few safe optimizations.  
**Made for my own taste and workflow. No guarantees. Use at your own risk.**
